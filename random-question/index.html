        <h3>Coding instructions:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Build a function constructor called Question to describe a question. A question should include: a question, correct answer and all answers the player can choose from</li>
            <li>Create a couple of questions & store them in an array</li>
            <li>Select one random question and log it on the console, together with the possible answers (each question should have a number) </li>
            <li>Use the 'prompt' function to ask the user for the correct answer. The user should input the number of the correct answer</li>
            <li>Print to the console whether the answer is correct or not</li>
            <li>After you display the result, display the next random question. Be careful to include the option to quit the game if the user writes 'exit' instead of the answer</li>
            <li>Track the user's score and display it in the console</li>
        </ul>
